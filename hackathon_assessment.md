## Solution Strengths

### Jai

- Attempted to implement all required functionality
- Extended test data with additional examples
- Basic implementation works for the test cases

### Abid

- Followed instructions by using the provided task.js file
- Better code organization with separate functions
- More efficient data structure usage (Map)
- Better approach to algorithm implementation

## Areas for Improvement

### Jai

- Code needs better modularity and organization
- Missing error handling for edge cases
- Logic is convoluted and difficult to maintain
- Algorithm implementation is inefficient
- Significantly exceeded ideal completion time

### Abid

- Failed to complete the date comparison logic
- Return format doesn't match requirements
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete implementation of core functionality
- Significantly exceeded ideal completion time

## Assessment Key Points

1. Neither solution is perfect - both have significant issues
2. Both participants took much longer than the ideal time of 1 hour 30 minutes
3. Jai's solution attempts to implement all requirements but has structural and efficiency issues
4. Abid's solution has better structure and algorithm approach but incomplete functionality
5. Abid completed the task approximately 14 minutes faster than Jai
6. Code organization and algorithm implementation are better in Abid's implementation
7. Implementation completeness is better in Jai's solution
8. Both solutions would require significant refactoring to be production-ready and efficient
